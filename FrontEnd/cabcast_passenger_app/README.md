# FrontEnd CabCast Passenger App README

# Project Local Setup

Please follow the below steps to create your local dev workspace for the frontend passenger app in mac. 
Please refer the respective official documentation for other operating system environments.

  1. First, you need to install Node.js and npm if they are not already installed. You can check if they are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:
     ### `node -v` `npm -v`
     If Node.js and npm are not installed, you can install them using Homebrew:
     ### `brew install node`

  2. Once Node.js and npm are installed, you can create a new Create React App project by running the following command in your terminal.
     Replace my-app with the name of your project:
     ### `npx create-react-app my-app`

  3. After the project is created, navigate into the project directory:
     ### `cd my-app`

   4. Now, you can start the development server:
      ### `npm start`

   5. Your new Create React App project is now set up and running. 
      Validate the setup by accessing the app by opening **http://localhost:3000** in your web browser.
      ### `http://localhost:3000`

   6. Clone and copy the contents of cabcast_passenger_app to your dev react workspace **my-app**

   7. Check the below dependecies in your dev react workspace 
      * [react-fontawesome](https://docs.fontawesome.com/web/use-with/react/)
      * ### `npm install react-router-dom`

   8. if all is well, you should see the cabcast app running your browser **http://localhost:3000**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
