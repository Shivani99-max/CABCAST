If you would like to create a local setup for deep dive analysis. Please refer the detailed instructions as part of the cabacast_passenger_app folder **(CABCAST/Frontend/cabacast_passenger_app/README.md)**

## UI/UX Test Data

The frontend react web UI does not fully integrate with the DotNet API and MS SQL backend. We have used static data for demo purposes

Please use the below dataset for experiencing the booking journey demo

```jsx
